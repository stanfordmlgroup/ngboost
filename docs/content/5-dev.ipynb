The distribution class must subclass the appropriate distribution type (either `RegressionDistn` or `ClassificationDistn`) and must implement methods for `fit()` and `sample()`. The scores compatible with the distribution should be stored in a class attribute called `score` and the number of parameters in an class attribute n_params.

        "If you don't want to use the log score (say you want CRP score, for example), then ngboost does not (yet?) have a default method for calculating the metric and you *must* derive and implement it yourself. This is harder than deriving a Fisher because there are not many worked examples. The most general derivation process should follow the outline [here](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2018/03/14/natural-gradient/), replacing the KL divergence (which is induced by the log score) with whichever divergence is induced by the scoring rule you want to use (e.g. L2 for CRPS), again taking care to derive with respect to the internal ngboost parameterization, not the user-facing one. For any particular score, there may be a specific closed-form expression that you can use to calculate the metric across distributions (the expression for the Fisher Info serves this purpose for the log score) or there may not be- I actually don't know the answer to this question! But if there were, that could suggest some kind of default implementation for that score's `metric()` method."
